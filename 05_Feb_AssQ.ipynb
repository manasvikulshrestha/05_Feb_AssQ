    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example. \n",
    "A1. A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.\n",
    "An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values."

    "A4. Self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” we can access the attributes and methods of the class in Python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments. The reason we need to use self is because Python does not use the @syntax to refer to instance attributes."
